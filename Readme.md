# DATA STRUCTURES FROM SCRATCH IN C
## Brief Description:
*Data structures and algorithms* are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming that play a crucial role in organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Here's a brief description of each:

**Data Structures**:
*Data structures* are containers or ways to store and organize data in a computer's memory. They provide different methods of accessing, adding, and removing data items. Common data structures include:
* **Arrays**: Contiguous blocks of memory that store elements of the same type, accessible through indices.
* **Linked Lists**: Collections of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (pointer) to the next node.
* **Stacks**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure that allows adding and removing elements from the same end.
* **Queues**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure that allows adding at the rear and removing from the front.
* **Trees**: Hierarchical structures composed of nodes with parent-child relationships.
* **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

**Algorithms**:
*Algorithms* are step-by-step procedures or instructions designed to solve specific problems or perform tasks efficiently. They can manipulate data, perform calculations, and make decisions based on inputs. Algorithms can be broadly categorized as:
* **Searching Algorithms**: Finding a specific element or value in a data structure (e.g., linear search, binary search).
* **Sorting Algorithms**: Arranging elements in a specific order (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort).
* **Graph Algorithms**: Solving problems involving graphs, such as finding the shortest path or spanning tree.
* **Dynamic Programming**: Solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems.
* **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices at each step to find a global optimum.

The study and understanding of data structures and algorithms are essential for programmers and developers to design efficient and optimized solutions for various computational problems. Proficiency in these concepts significantly impacts the performance and scalability of software applications and systems.
